R
	 <- is equal to = (assignment operator)
	ls() list of all variables created in the current session
	c() stands for combine
	R only allows one data  variable in a vector after c()
	vector is addressed with vectorname[index] 1 based
	rbind() to combine dataframes
	str(variablename)
	summary(variablename)
	
	which.min() gives row number
	nrow() gives number of rows
	hist()
	boxplot(varibale1~varibale2) circles are outliers , middle line is median, dashed lines are whiskers, 
	table(variable)
	tapply(varibale1,variable2,mean)
	tappy(who$literacyrate,who$region,min,na.rm=TRUE) - this removes all NA values hence giving correct min
	subset(datavar,var_condition)
	DateConvert = as.Date(strptime(mvt$Date, "%m/%d/%y %H:%M"))
	factor() how does it work ? 

	tapply(data, factors or "groups", function)
	Question: Which state has a proportion of interviewees living in a non-metropolitan area closest to 30%?
	"Which state" --> factoring or grouping by state
	"interviewees living in non-metropolitan area" ---> data the function "mean" is applied
	An additional tip: If you sort the results of tapply() it's much easier to read the output and to find the solution.
	sort(tapply(...), decreasing = TRUE/FALSE)
