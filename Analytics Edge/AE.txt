R
	 <- is equal to = (assignment operator)
	ls() list of all variables created in the current session
	c() stands for combine
	R only allows one data  variable in a vector after c()
	vector is addressed with vectorname[index] 1 based
	rbind() to combine dataframes
	str(variablename)
	summary(variablename)
	
	which.min() gives row number
	nrow() gives number of rows
	hist()
	boxplot(varibale1~varibale2) circles are outliers , middle line is median, dashed lines are whiskers, 
	table(variable)
	tapply(varibale1,variable2,mean)
	tappy(who$literacyrate,who$region,min,na.rm=TRUE) - this removes all NA values hence giving correct min
	subset(datavar,var_condition)
	DateConvert = as.Date(strptime(mvt$Date, "%m/%d/%y %H:%M"))
	factor() how does it work ?
